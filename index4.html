    <p>Frontend development has its focus on the user interface, i.e what users see and interact with in their browser or application.
      Pictures, buttons, forms, texts and colours are all part of the frontend practice. One of the main objectives for a person
      working as a frontend developer is to make sure that the site (or application) is functional, easy to use, relevant, has appealing
      design and comes up correctly in different browsers.
      Frontend, or client-side as it sometimes is referred to, is mainly built up by three different languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
